<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Am a mechatronics engineer by profession, however i have been coding since i was 13 years old. I own a small electronics manufacturing lab and finding an inventory app for my parts has been a long time problem.

There are many great Inventory apps available either open source or commercial; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create an inventory app thats simple, customizable and easier for your awesome lab inventory -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* A project that solves a problem and helps others
* Its simple and easily customizable to suit your needs.
* Its open source :smile:

Of course, no one app will serve all and your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future if time and resources allow. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

Enjoy.
